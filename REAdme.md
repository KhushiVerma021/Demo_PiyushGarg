# Forked Repository Practice

## Description:
This repository was forked as a part of college assignment to practice git and github workflows.
The tasks performed include forking the repository, cloning it to the local system, adding a new file with content and creating a '.gitignore' 
file to manage the untracked files effectively.

## Steps:
1. **Forked a repository**:
   - forked the repository using the 'Fork' button on github to create a copy under my github account.
 
2. **Cloned the repository**:
   - Used the 'git clone <url-of-the-repository> 'command to clone the forked repository in the local system.

3.  **Made Changes locally**:
   - created a file using touch <file-name> command.
   - added some content in it using echo "<File-content>" > "file-name" command.
   - staged the changes using 'git add .' command.
   - committed the changes using 'git commit -m"commit-message" ' command.
   - And at the end pushes the changes to the remote repository using git push origin master command.

4.  **Created a pull request**:
   - Navigated to my forked repository on github.
   - Opened the "Pull Request" tab and clicked "New Pull Request".
   - Comparedmy forked repository with original repository.
   _ Added a title for the pull request and submitted for the review.
